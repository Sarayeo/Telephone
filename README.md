### What to know about the project

I'm am still working on the process of adding the number in the input in 
my history of calls.
However when arriving on the page you can actualy add a contact to the store.
The so contact then shows up on your feed and you get the possibility to add 
the number of the actual contact in the entry screen for the calls.
it will allow you therefore to to then make a call wich will be added to your history of calls
page with the name and the date of the number you called.

```
npm install
```
